# 303COM-Age-Verification-via-Facial-Recognition-App

Application to offer two main interfaces:

* Scan a webpage using a Regular Expression to see if keywords appear at the provided URl

* Capture a photo of the user via webcam and then call facial recognition software to determine their age (Facial Recognition Age Predictor hosted on another port)

Both of these interfaces only run locally so that no data is passed to external APIs hosted remotely to keep data secure and private

Google Chrome extension to call these interfaces when needed (i.e. when age-restricted keywords are on the current webpage)
